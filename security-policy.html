            <h1>Security Policy</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Baketopia's Security Policy. The purpose of this policy is to define the rules and expectations for safeguarding our users, systems, and network. By using our services, you agree to comply with these guidelines to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our systems and data.</p>
    
            <h2>1. Identification and Authentication Policy</h2>
            <p>Our authentication process ensures that users and administrators are properly verified before accessing the system. Each user is assigned a unique username and password, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for administrators.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users must provide valid credentials (username and password) to access their accounts.</li>
                <li>Administrators must use MFA in addition to their credentials for added security.</li>
                <li>Sessions will automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>2. Password Policy</h2>
            <p>To maintain a high level of security, we enforce strict password requirements for all users and administrators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Password must be at least 12 characters long.</li>
                <li>It should include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
                <li>Password change is mandatory every 90 days.</li>
                <li>Users must not reuse previous passwords for the past 5 password changes.</li>
                <li>Passwords must be stored securely using a hashed and salted encryption method.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>3. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h2>
            <p>The Acceptable Use Policy sets the guidelines for what is considered appropriate behavior on our network and systems. All users must adhere to the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users must not engage in any illegal activities or access prohibited content through the network.</li>
                <li>Users must respect the privacy and confidentiality of others and refrain from accessing, modifying, or deleting data without authorization.</li>
                <li>Any attempt to exploit system vulnerabilities or conduct unauthorized penetration testing will result in immediate termination of access.</li>
                <li>Use of personal devices on the network should be limited to company-approved devices that have updated security protocols.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>4. Remote Access Policy</h2>
            <p>For employees and administrators requiring remote access, we enforce the following policies to ensure a secure connection to the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remote access is only permitted via a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) that encrypts all traffic.</li>
                <li>All remote connections must use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added protection.</li>
                <li>Access to sensitive data should be limited to only those who require it for their role, following the principle of least privilege.</li>
                <li>Employees should ensure their personal devices are protected with updated anti-virus software before accessing company resources remotely.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>5. Network Maintenance Policy</h2>
            <p>Regular maintenance is crucial for ensuring the network remains secure and functions efficiently. This policy outlines the procedures for maintaining and monitoring the network:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network security patches and software updates will be applied monthly to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>All network traffic will be monitored for suspicious activity, and logs will be retained for a minimum of 6 months.</li>
                <li>Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests will be conducted to identify potential weaknesses.</li>
                <li>Access to the network will be limited to authorized personnel only, and the network will be segmented to minimize risk exposure.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>6. Incident Handling Procedure</h2>
            <p>In the event of a security incident, prompt action is required to mitigate damage and restore normal operations. Our incident handling procedure includes the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Security personnel will continuously monitor for signs of malicious activity or breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Once a security incident is detected, it will be contained to prevent further damage, including isolating affected systems if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Eradication:</strong> Any malicious software or unauthorized access will be removed from the network, and the affected systems will be cleaned.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Systems will be restored from clean backups, and any vulnerabilities exploited during the incident will be addressed.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Incident Analysis:</strong> A full review of the incident will be conducted to learn from the experience and prevent future occurrences.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By following this security policy, we aim to protect our users, administrators, and the integrity of our systems. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our security team at <strong>security@baketopia.com</strong>.</p>
